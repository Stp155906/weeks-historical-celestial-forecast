To describe this in your GitHub repository's README, you want to provide a clear and concise explanation of what the repository does, how the workflow is set up, and how others can use the generated JSON data. Here's a sample section you can include in your README:

## Week's Historical Celestial Forecast

This repository contains a Python script that generates a JSON file predicting historical celestial aspects for the current week. The forecast includes planetary alignments, sentiment analysis, and historical context derived from past events.

### Features

- **Planetary Aspect Analysis**: Calculates celestial aspects (e.g., conjunctions, oppositions) for the current week.
- **Historical Context**: Matches current aspects with similar historical events using data fetched from Wikipedia.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assigns a sentiment score to each historical event description using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- **JSON Output**: The results are saved in a JSON file and automatically committed to the repository.

### Workflow Overview

This repository is equipped with a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. **Runs the Python script** to generate the week's historical celestial forecast.
2. **Commits the JSON output** (`weeks_historical_celestial_forecast.json`) directly to the repository.
3. **Schedules**: The workflow is scheduled to run daily at midnight UTC, and can also be triggered manually.

### How to Use the JSON Data

The generated JSON file is accessible directly from the repository. You can use the raw link to retrieve the data programmatically or for testing in tools like Postman.

**Raw JSON URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/weeks-historical-celestial-forecast/main/weeks_historical_celestial_forecast.json
```

### Example JSON Structure

```json
{
    "aspect_key": "venus-jupiter-square",
    "date": "2023-08-17",
    "event_category": "War",
    "event_name": "2023 (MMXXIII) was a common...",
    "sentiment_score": -0.9996,
    "historical_context": "Venus Jupiter Square has historically coincided with periods of war...",
    "summary": "On 2023-08-17, during the aspect venus-jupiter-square, the event '2023 (MMXXIII) was a common...' occurred, categorized as War."
}
```

### Setup and Running the Workflow

To run the workflow manually:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the repository.
2. Click on the **Week's Historical Celestial Forecast** workflow.
3. Trigger a run using the **Run workflow** button.
